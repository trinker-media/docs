## Overview

Auto-publish allows you to schedule articles for automatic publication, so you can set up your content calendar and let Genseo handle the publishing. This guide covers setting up auto-publish, managing schedules, and pausing or rescheduling content.

## How Auto-Publish Works

Auto-publish automatically publishes articles at scheduled times without manual intervention. Once you set up a schedule, Genseo will:

1. Generate articles based on your keywords
2. Schedule them for publication
3. Automatically publish them at the scheduled time
4. Notify you when articles are published

## Setting Up Auto-Publish

### Step 1: Enable Auto-Publish

1. Go to **Settings** → **Auto-Publish**
2. Toggle **Enable Auto-Publish** to on
3. Configure your default settings:
   - Publishing frequency (daily, weekly, etc.)
   - Default publishing time
   - Default integration (Webflow or Shopify)

### Step 2: Configure Schedule

Set up your publishing schedule:

1. **Choose frequency**: How often to publish (daily, weekly, multiple times per week)
2. **Set times**: What time of day to publish
3. **Select days**: Which days of the week to publish
4. **Choose integration**: Which integration to publish to

<Tip>
Start with a conservative schedule (e.g., 2-3 articles per week) and increase as you build your content pipeline.
</Tip>

### Step 3: Add Keywords

Add keywords that will be automatically turned into articles:

1. Go to **Keywords**
2. Add keywords you want to publish
3. Keywords will be automatically used for article generation
4. Articles will be scheduled based on your auto-publish settings

## Managing Schedules

### Changing Schedules

Update your publishing schedule:

1. Go to **Settings** → **Auto-Publish**
2. Modify your schedule settings:
   - Change frequency
   - Adjust publishing times
   - Update which days to publish
3. Click **Save**

Changes will apply to newly scheduled articles. Existing scheduled articles will keep their current schedules.

### Individual Article Schedules

Override auto-publish schedule for specific articles:

1. Open the article you want to schedule differently
2. Click **Schedule**
3. Set a custom date and time
4. Click **Schedule**

The article will be published at your custom time instead of the auto-publish schedule.

### Bulk Scheduling

Schedule multiple articles at once:

1. Go to **Calendar**
2. Select multiple articles
3. Click **Schedule**
4. Set a schedule for all selected articles
5. Click **Confirm**

All selected articles will be scheduled accordingly.

## Pausing Auto-Publish

Temporarily stop automatic publishing without deleting scheduled articles.

### Pause Auto-Publish

1. Go to **Settings** → **Auto-Publish**
2. Toggle **Enable Auto-Publish** to off
3. Click **Save**

Auto-publish will be paused, but scheduled articles will remain scheduled. You can manually publish them or resume auto-publish later.

### What Happens When Paused

When auto-publish is paused:

- **Scheduled articles remain**: Articles already scheduled will keep their schedules
- **New articles won't auto-schedule**: New articles won't be automatically scheduled
- **Manual publishing still works**: You can still manually publish articles
- **Can resume anytime**: You can re-enable auto-publish at any time

## Rescheduling Content

Change when scheduled articles will be published.

### Reschedule Individual Articles

1. Open the article you want to reschedule
2. Click **Edit Schedule**
3. Change the publication date and time
4. Click **Save**

The article will be rescheduled to the new time.

### Reschedule Multiple Articles

1. Go to **Calendar**
2. Select multiple articles
3. Click **Reschedule**
4. Set a new schedule for all selected articles
5. Click **Confirm**

All selected articles will be rescheduled.

### Cancel Schedules

Remove schedules from articles:

1. Open the article you want to unschedule
2. Click **Cancel Schedule**
3. Confirm cancellation

The article will no longer be scheduled. You can schedule it again later or publish it manually.

## Best Practices

### Planning

- **Plan ahead**: Set up auto-publish schedules weeks or months in advance
- **Balance frequency**: Don't over-publish—maintain a consistent, sustainable schedule
- **Consider your audience**: Publish when your audience is most active

### Management

- **Review scheduled content**: Regularly review what's scheduled to ensure quality
- **Adjust as needed**: Modify schedules based on performance and feedback
- **Maintain flexibility**: Be ready to pause or adjust schedules when needed
- **Monitor automation**: Keep an eye on auto-publish to ensure it's working correctly

### Quality Control

- **Review before publishing**: Consider reviewing articles before they're auto-published
