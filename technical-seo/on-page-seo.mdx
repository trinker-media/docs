## Overview

On-page SEO involves optimizing individual pages to rank higher in search results. This guide covers title tags, H1 structure, subheadings, keyword placement, internal linking, and readability principles.

## Title Tags

Title tags are one of the most important on-page SEO elements.

### What Are Title Tags?

Title tags are HTML elements that define the title of a web page. They appear in search results and browser tabs.

### Title Tag Best Practices

- **Length**: Keep title tags under 60 characters to avoid truncation
- **Keyword placement**: Include your primary keyword near the beginning
- **Unique titles**: Use unique title tags for each page
- **Descriptive**: Make title tags descriptive and compelling
- **Brand inclusion**: Include your brand name when relevant (usually at the end)

### Title Tag Examples

**Good**:
```
How to Optimize SEO for E-commerce Stores | Genseo
```

**Bad**:
```
SEO
```

### Title Tag Structure

A good title tag structure:

1. **Primary keyword**: Include the primary keyword near the beginning
2. **Descriptive text**: Add descriptive text that explains what the page is about
3. **Brand name**: Include your brand name (optional, usually at the end)

## H1 Structure

H1 tags define the main heading of a page.

### What Are H1 Tags?

H1 tags are HTML elements that indicate the main heading of a page. Each page should have exactly one H1 tag.

### H1 Best Practices

- **One per page**: Use only one H1 tag per page
- **Keyword inclusion**: Include your primary keyword in the H1
- **Descriptive**: Make the H1 descriptive and clear
- **Match title tag**: H1 should be similar to (but not identical to) the title tag
- **User-focused**: Write H1 for users, not just for SEO

### H1 Examples

**Good**:
```html
<h1>How to Optimize SEO for E-commerce Stores</h1>
```

**Bad**:
```html
<h1>SEO</h1>
```

## Subheadings (H2, H3, etc.)

Subheadings organize content and improve readability and SEO.

### Heading Hierarchy

Maintain a logical heading hierarchy:

- **H1**: Main title (one per page)
- **H2**: Major sections
- **H3**: Subsections within H2 sections
- **H4+**: Further subdivisions as needed

<Tip>
Don't skip heading levels. If you use H2, don't jump to H4—use H3 in between.
</Tip>

### Subheading Best Practices

- **Logical structure**: Use headings to create a logical content structure
- **Keyword variations**: Include keyword variations in subheadings
- **Descriptive**: Make subheadings descriptive and informative
- **Scannable**: Write subheadings that are easy to scan
- **User-focused**: Write subheadings for users, not just for SEO

### Subheading Examples

**Good**:
```html
<h2>Keyword Research for E-commerce</h2>
<h3>Finding Product Keywords</h3>
<h3>Analyzing Keyword Competition</h3>
```

**Bad**:
```html
<h2>Keywords</h2>
<h4>Research</h4>
```

## Keyword Placement

Strategic keyword placement helps search engines understand your content.

### Where to Place Keywords

Place keywords in:

1. **Title tag**: Include primary keyword near the beginning
2. **H1**: Include primary keyword in the H1
3. **First paragraph**: Include primary keyword early in the introduction
4. **Subheadings**: Use keyword variations in H2 and H3 headings
5. **Body content**: Use keywords naturally throughout the content
6. **Meta description**: Include primary keyword in the meta description
7. **URL slug**: Use primary keyword in the URL slug
8. **Alt text**: Include keywords in image alt text when relevant

### Keyword Density

Keyword density refers to how often a keyword appears relative to total words.

**Best practices**:
- **Natural usage**: Use keywords naturally—don't stuff them
- **Variations**: Use keyword variations and synonyms
- **Focus on users**: Write for users first, SEO second
- **Avoid over-optimization**: Don't overuse keywords—it hurts readability and SEO

<Tip>
There's no magic keyword density number. Focus on natural, readable content that uses keywords appropriately.
</Tip>

## Internal Linking

Internal links connect related content on your site.

### What Are Internal Links?

Internal links are links from one page on your site to another page on your site. They help users navigate and help search engines understand your site structure.

### Internal Linking Benefits

- **User navigation**: Help users find related content
- **SEO value**: Distribute page authority throughout your site
- **Site structure**: Help search engines understand your site structure
- **Dwell time**: Keep users on your site longer

### Internal Linking Best Practices

- **Relevant links**: Link to content that's relevant to the current page
- **Descriptive anchor text**: Use descriptive anchor text that explains what the linked page is about
- **Natural placement**: Place links where they make sense contextually
- **Don't over-link**: Too many links can hurt readability and SEO
- **Link to important pages**: Prioritize linking to important, high-value pages
