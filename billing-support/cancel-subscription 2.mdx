## Canceling Your Subscription

### Step 1: Access Billing Settings

1. Log in to your Genseo account
2. Go to **Settings** → **Billing**
3. Navigate to the **Subscription** section

</Tip>

## Effective-at-Period-End Policy

Genseo uses an effective-at-period-end cancellation policy.

### How It Works

When you cancel your subscription:

- **Immediate effect**: Cancellation is processed immediately
- **Access continues**: You continue to have access until the end of your current billing period
- **No immediate refund**: You're not refunded for the remainder of your billing period
- **Automatic cancellation**: Your subscription automatically cancels at the end of your billing period

### Example Scenario

**Current situation**:
- Billing cycle: Monthly (resets on the 15th)
- Today's date: January 5th
- Next billing date: January 15th

**After cancellation**:
- Cancellation processed: January 5th
- Access continues until: January 15th
- Subscription ends: January 15th
- No access after: January 15th

### What Happens at the End of Your Billing Period

When your billing period ends:

1. **Subscription ends**: Your subscription is canceled
2. **Access revoked**: You lose access to paid features
3. **Data retained**: Your data is retained for a period (check data retention policy)
4. **No further charges**: You're not charged for future billing periods

## What Happens After Cancellation

### Immediate Effects

- **Cancellation confirmed**: You receive a confirmation of cancellation
- **Access continues**: You continue to have access until the end of your billing period
- **No new charges**: You won't be charged for future billing periods

### At the End of Your Billing Period

- **Access ends**: You lose access to paid features
- **Data access**: You may lose access to your data (check data retention policy)
- **Export data**: Consider exporting your data before cancellation takes effect

### Data Retention

Genseo retains your data for a period after cancellation:

- **Retention period**: Check Genseo's data retention policy for specific details
- **Data export**: Export your data before cancellation takes effect if needed
- **Data deletion**: Data may be deleted after the retention period

## Reactivating Your Subscription

If you change your mind, you can reactivate your subscription.

### Before Cancellation Takes Effect

If you cancel but want to reactivate before the end of your billing period:

1. Go to **Settings** → **Billing**
2. Click **Reactivate Subscription** or **Restore Subscription**
3. Confirm reactivation
4. Your subscription is immediately reactivated

### After Cancellation Takes Effect

If your subscription has already been canceled:

1. Log in to your Genseo account
2. Go to **Settings** → **Billing**
3. Click **Reactivate Subscription** or **Restore Subscription**
4. Select your plan and payment method
5. Confirm reactivation
6. Your subscription is reactivated, and you're charged immediately

<Tip>
Reactivating after cancellation may require setting up a new payment method if your previous one was removed.
</Tip>

## Common Questions

### What happens to my articles after I cancel?

Your articles may be retained for a period after cancellation, but you'll lose access to them. Export your articles before cancellation takes effect if you want to keep them.

Cancellation is processed immediately, but access continues until the end of your current billing period. You're not refunded for the remainder of your billing period.

### How do I reactivate after canceling?

Go to **Settings** → **Billing** → **Reactivate Subscription** to reactivate your subscription. You may need to set up a new payment method.
