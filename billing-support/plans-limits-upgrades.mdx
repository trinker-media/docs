## Overview

Genseo offers different plans with varying article limits and features. This guide explains monthly article limits, how upgrades affect your limits, and how billing cycles work.

## Monthly Article Limits

Each plan includes a monthly article limit that determines how many articles you can generate per month.

### How Limits Work

- **Monthly reset**: Article limits reset at the beginning of each billing cycle
- **Per account**: Limits apply to your entire account, not per user
- **Unused articles**: Unused articles don't roll over to the next month
- **Overage**: Exceeding your limit may require upgrading or waiting until the next billing cycle

### Understanding Your Limit

Check your current limit and usage:

1. Go to **Settings** → **Billing**
2. View your current plan and article limit
3. Check how many articles you've used this month
4. See how many articles remain in your current billing cycle

<Tip>
Monitor your article usage throughout the month to avoid hitting your limit unexpectedly.

## Upgrades and Limits

Upgrading your plan increases your monthly article limit and unlocks additional features.

### How Upgrades Work

When you upgrade your plan:

1. **Immediate effect**: Your new limit takes effect immediately
2. **Prorated billing**: You may be charged a prorated amount for the remainder of your billing cycle
3. **New limit**: Your monthly article limit increases to the new plan's limit
4. **Additional features**: You gain access to additional features included in the new plan

### Upgrading Mid-Cycle

If you upgrade mid-cycle:

- **Immediate access**: You immediately gain access to the new plan's limit
- **Prorated charge**: You're charged a prorated amount for the upgrade
- **Reset date**: Your billing cycle reset date remains the same
- **Usage tracking**: Your article usage continues from your current usage

### Example Upgrade Scenario

**Current situation**:
- Plan: Starter (20 articles/month)
- Articles used: 18 articles
- Days remaining: 10 days

**After upgrade**:
- New plan: Professional (100 articles/month)
- Articles available: 100 articles (immediate)
- Prorated charge: Applied for the upgrade
- Reset date: Remains the same (10 days)

## Billing Cycles

Billing cycles determine when your article limits reset and when you're charged.

### Monthly Billing

- **Billing period**: 30 days from your signup or upgrade date
- **Reset date**: Article limits reset on your billing date
- **Charge date**: You're charged on your billing date
- **Usage tracking**: Article usage is tracked per billing cycle

### Annual Billing

- **Billing period**: 365 days from your signup or upgrade date
- **Reset date**: Article limits reset monthly (not annually)
- **Charge date**: You're charged annually on your billing date
- **Usage tracking**: Article usage is tracked per month, with limits resetting monthly

<Tip>
Annual billing often includes discounts compared to monthly billing. Check pricing for current offers.

## Managing Your Limits

### Monitoring Usage

Track your article usage:

1. **Dashboard**: Check your dashboard for current usage
2. **Billing settings**: View detailed usage in billing settings
3. **Notifications**: Receive notifications when approaching your limit
4. **Usage history**: Review past usage to plan future needs

### Avoiding Limit Issues

Plan your content to avoid hitting limits:

- **Monitor usage**: Regularly check your article usage
- **Plan ahead**: Schedule content to avoid exceeding limits
- **Upgrade when needed**: Upgrade before hitting your limit
- **Optimize usage**: Use articles efficiently to maximize value

### When You Hit Your Limit

If you exceed your monthly limit:

1. **Upgrade option**: Upgrade to a higher plan for more articles
2. **Wait for reset**: Wait until your billing cycle resets
3. **Contact support**: Contact support for custom solutions
4. **Review usage**: Review your usage to optimize future content planning

## Downgrades and Limits

Downgrading your plan reduces your monthly article limit.

### How Downgrades Work

When you downgrade your plan:

1. **Effective date**: Downgrade takes effect at the end of your current billing cycle
2. **New limit**: Your monthly article limit decreases to the new plan's limit
3. **Current usage**: Your current usage remains until the billing cycle resets
4. **Feature access**: You lose access to features not included in the new plan

### Downgrading Mid-Cycle

If you downgrade mid-cycle:

- **Current cycle**: You keep your current plan's limit until the end of the billing cycle
- **Next cycle**: The new plan's limit applies at the start of the next billing cycle
- **No refund**: You're not refunded for the remainder of the current cycle
- **Feature access**: You keep feature access until the end of the current cycle

## Best Practices

### Planning Your Usage

- **Monitor regularly**: Check your usage throughout the month
- **Plan content**: Schedule content to maximize your article limit
- **Upgrade proactively**: Upgrade before hitting your limit to avoid interruptions
- **Optimize articles**: Use articles efficiently to get the most value

### Managing Billing

- **Understand cycles**: Know when your billing cycle resets
