## Overview

Genseo's affiliate program allows you to earn commissions by referring new customers. This guide covers commission rates, payout timing, how to share referral links, and how attribution works.

## How the Affiliate Program Works

### Earning Commissions

When you refer someone to Genseo:

1. **Share your link**: Share your unique referral link with potential customers
2. **Customer signs up**: The customer signs up using your referral link
3. **Attribution**: The sign-up is attributed to your referral
4. **Commission earned**: You earn a commission when the customer subscribes

### Commission Structure

Commissions are typically calculated as a percentage of the customer's subscription revenue.

**Example**:
- Commission rate: 20%
- Customer's monthly plan: $100/month
- Your commission: $20/month (for as long as the customer remains subscribed)

<Tip>
Commission rates and structures may vary. Check your affiliate dashboard for specific commission rates and terms.
</Tip>

## Commission Percentage

Commission rates vary based on the affiliate program tier and customer plan.

### Standard Commission Rates

- **Starter plans**: Typically 10-15% commission
- **Professional plans**: Typically 15-20% commission
- **Enterprise plans**: Typically 20-25% commission or custom rates

<Note>
Specific commission rates may vary. Check your affiliate dashboard for your specific commission rates.
</Note>

### Commission Tiers

Some affiliate programs offer tiered commission rates:

- **Bronze tier**: Base commission rate
- **Silver tier**: Higher commission rate (after reaching certain referral thresholds)
- **Gold tier**: Highest commission rate (after reaching higher referral thresholds)

## Payout Timing

Commissions are paid out according to the affiliate program's payout schedule.

### Payout Schedule

- **Monthly payouts**: Commissions are paid monthly, typically 30-60 days after the customer's payment
- **Minimum payout**: There's usually a minimum payout threshold (e.g., $50 or $100)
- **Payment method**: Payouts are made via PayPal, bank transfer, or other methods

### Payout Process

1. **Accumulate commissions**: Commissions accumulate as customers subscribe and pay
2. **Reach minimum**: When you reach the minimum payout threshold, you're eligible for payout
3. **Payout processing**: Payouts are processed according to the payout schedule
4. **Payment received**: You receive payment via your selected payment method

<Tip>
Monitor your affiliate dashboard to track your commission earnings and payout status.
</Tip>

## Referral Links

Your referral link is a unique URL that tracks sign-ups attributed to you.

### Getting Your Referral Link

1. Go to **Settings** → **Affiliate** or **Referrals**
2. Find your unique referral link
3. Copy your referral link
4. Share it with potential customers

### Using Your Referral Link

Share your referral link:

- **Email**: Include your referral link in emails to potential customers
- **Social media**: Share your referral link on social media
- **Website**: Add your referral link to your website or blog
- **Direct sharing**: Share your referral link directly with potential customers

### Referral Link Format

Your referral link typically looks like:

```
https://app.genseo.co/sign-up?ref=YOUR_REFERRAL_CODE
```

<Tip>
Use your referral link consistently to ensure proper attribution of sign-ups.
</Tip>

## Attribution Rules

Attribution determines which affiliate gets credit for a referral.

### How Attribution Works

Attribution is typically based on:

- **First click**: The first referral link the customer clicks
- **Last click**: The last referral link the customer clicks before signing up
- **Cookie duration**: How long the attribution cookie lasts (typically 30-90 days)

### Attribution Window

The attribution window determines how long a referral link remains valid:

- **Standard window**: Typically 30-90 days
- **Cookie-based**: Attribution is stored in a cookie
- **Expiration**: Attribution expires after the attribution window

### Multiple Referrals

If a customer clicks multiple referral links:

- **First click wins**: The first referral link typically gets attribution
- **Last click wins**: Some programs use last-click attribution
- **Check program rules**: Review the affiliate program rules for specific attribution rules

## Tracking Your Referrals

### Affiliate Dashboard

Monitor your referrals and commissions:

1. Go to **Settings** → **Affiliate** or **Referrals**
2. View your affiliate dashboard
3. Track:
   - Number of referrals
   - Commission earnings
   - Payout status
   - Referral links performance

### Key Metrics

Track these metrics:

- **Total referrals**: Number of customers who signed up using your link
- **Active referrals**: Number of customers currently subscribed

- **Pending payouts**: Commissions pending payout
- **Paid out**: Commissions already paid out
