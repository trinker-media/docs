## Connecting WordPress in Genseo

### Step 1: Access WordPress Profile

1. Open your WordPress admin dashboard
2. In the sidebar, navigate to **Users** → **Profile**

This will open your user profile page where you can manage your account settings and application passwords.

### Step 2: Copy Username and Website

1. On your profile page, locate the **Username** field
2. Copy your username
3. In Genseo, navigate to **Settings** → **Integrations** → **WordPress**
4. Paste your username into the **Username** field in Genseo
5. Locate the **Website** field on your WordPress profile page
6. Copy your website URL
7. Paste the website URL into the **Website** field in Genseo

<Tip>
Make sure to copy the full website URL including `https://` or `http://` protocol.
</Tip>

### Step 3: Create Application Password

WordPress uses application passwords for secure API access. You'll need to create one for Genseo:

1. Scroll down to the **Application Passwords** section on your WordPress profile page
2. In the **New Application Password Name** field, enter **"Genseo"**
3. Click **Add New Application Password** or **Generate Password**
4. WordPress will generate a password for you
5. **Important**: Copy this password immediately - you won't be able to see it again
6. Paste the application password into the **Password** field in Genseo

<Warning>
Application passwords are displayed only once. If you lose the password, you'll need to create a new one. Make sure to copy it before closing the dialog.
</Warning>

### Step 4: Test Connection

1. In Genseo, click **Test Connection** to verify your credentials
2. If successful, you'll see a confirmation message
3. Click **Save** to complete the setup

Your WordPress site is now connected to Genseo and ready to receive articles.

## Publishing Articles to WordPress

### Immediate Publishing

1. Generate or open an article in Genseo
2. Click **Publish**
3. Select **WordPress** as the destination
4. Review the preview
5. Click **Confirm**

The article will be published to your WordPress blog immediately.

### Scheduled Publishing

1. Generate or open an article
2. Click **Schedule**
3. Select your publish date and time
4. Choose **WordPress** as the destination
5. Click **Schedule**

The article will be published automatically at the scheduled time.

## Updating Articles

When you update an article in Genseo:

1. Make your edits in the Genseo editor
2. Click **Update**
3. Select **Update in WordPress**
4. Confirm the update

<Tip>
Genseo maintains a connection between articles and WordPress posts. Updates will overwrite the existing WordPress post, preserving the original publish date.

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Connection Failed

**Problem**: The connection test fails or you can't connect to WordPress.

**Solution**:
- Verify your username is correct (case-sensitive)
- Check that your website URL includes the protocol (`https://` or `http://`)
- Ensure the application password was copied correctly (no extra spaces)
- Make sure your WordPress site is accessible and not behind a firewall
- Verify that Application Passwords are enabled in WordPress (available in WordPress 5.6+)

### "Invalid Credentials" Error

**Problem**: Genseo shows an "Invalid Credentials" error.

**Solution**:
- Double-check that you copied the application password correctly
- Create a new application password if you're unsure
- Verify your username matches exactly (check for typos)
- Ensure your website URL is correct and accessible

### "Application Passwords Not Available" Error

**Problem**: You don't see the Application Passwords section in WordPress.

**Solution**:
- Application Passwords require WordPress 5.6 or higher - update WordPress if needed
- Ensure you're logged in as an Administrator
- Check if a security plugin is blocking Application Passwords
- Some managed WordPress hosts may disable Application Passwords - contact your host

### Articles Published But Not Visible

**Problem**: Articles are published but don't appear on your WordPress site.

**Solution**:
- Check your WordPress post status - ensure posts are set to "Published"
- Verify your WordPress theme displays blog posts correctly
- Check if you have any caching plugins that need to be cleared
- Review your WordPress permalink settings
- Ensure the post category is set correctly

### Featured Image Not Appearing

**Problem**: Featured images from Genseo don't appear in WordPress.

**Solution**:
- Verify that your WordPress theme supports featured images
- Check that the image URL is accessible
- Ensure your WordPress media library has sufficient space
- Try uploading the image directly to WordPress media library first

### Slug Conflicts

**Problem**: Multiple articles try to use the same URL slug.

**Solution**:
- Genseo automatically handles slug conflicts by adding numbers
- Manually edit slugs in WordPress if needed
- Consider using unique identifiers in your slug pattern
- Review your WordPress permalink structure

## Best Practices

### SEO Optimization

- **Meta descriptions**: Ensure your WordPress theme supports meta descriptions or use an SEO plugin
- **Featured images**: Always include featured images for better social sharing
- **Categories and tags**: Use relevant categories and tags for better organization
- **Permalinks**: Configure WordPress permalinks to use post names for SEO-friendly URLs

### Content Management

- **Test first**: Publish a test article before scheduling multiple articles
- **Backup content**: Keep copies of important articles outside WordPress
- **Monitor publishing**: Check your WordPress dashboard after publishing to ensure articles appear correctly
- **Review formatting**: WordPress may render content differently - review published articles

### Performance

- **Image optimization**: Optimize images before publishing to improve site speed
- **Caching**: Use caching plugins to improve site performance
- **CDN**: Consider using a CDN for faster image delivery

### Security

- **Application passwords**: Use unique application passwords for each service
- **Regular updates**: Keep WordPress updated for security patches
- **Strong passwords**: Use strong passwords for your WordPress admin account
- **Limit access**: Only grant necessary permissions to application passwords
