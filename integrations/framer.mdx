## Common Issues and Solutions

### Connection Failed

**Problem**: The API key doesn't work or connection fails.

**Solution**:
- Verify you copied the entire API key correctly
- Make sure you generated a new API key in Genseo
- Try disconnecting and reconnecting the integration

### Articles Not Syncing

**Problem**: Articles don't appear after clicking sync.

**Solution**:
- Ensure the collection is properly connected in Framer
- Verify the API key is still valid in Genseo
- Check that articles are published in Genseo before syncing
- Try disconnecting and reconnecting the integration

### Collection Not Found

**Problem**: Can't find the collection in Framer.

**Solution**:
- Make sure you created the collection when setting up the plugin
- Verify you're looking in the correct Framer project
- Try creating a new collection and reconnecting

## Best Practices

- **Regular syncing**: Since Framer doesn't support auto-publishing, set a reminder to sync regularly
- **Test first**: Sync a test article before syncing multiple articles
- **Monitor syncs**: Check your Framer collection after syncing to ensure articles appear correctly
