## Connecting Webflow in Genseo

### Step 1: Start the Connection

1. In the dashboard sidebar, click **Integrations**
2. Find **Webflow** in the list and click **Connect**

This opens the Webflow OAuth pop-up window. If the window is blocked by your browser, allow pop-ups for Genseo.

### Step 2: Authorize Webflow

1. Sign in to Webflow if you are not already authenticated
2. Wait a few seconds while Webflow loads your workspaces
3. Select the Webflow site (project) you want to connect
4. Confirm the requested permissions

You will be redirected back to Genseo once the authorization succeeds.

### Step 3: Pick a Collection and Map Fields

After the redirect, Genseo shows a pop-up with your collections.

1. Choose the CMS collection that should receive newly published items
2. Map your fields
3. Click **Save** to persist the mapping

## Publishing Articles to Webflow

### Immediate Publishing

1. Generate or open an article in Genseo
2. Click **Publish**
3. Select **Webflow** as the destination
4. Review the preview
5. Click **Confirm**

The article will be published to your Webflow CMS immediately.

### Scheduled Publishing

1. Generate or open an article
2. Click **Schedule**
3. Select your publish date and time
4. Choose **Webflow** as the destination
5. Click **Schedule**

The article will be published automatically at the scheduled time.

## Updating Articles

When you update an article in Genseo:

1. Make your edits in the Genseo editor
2. Click **Update**
3. Select **Update in Webflow**
4. Confirm the update

<Tip>
  Genseo maintains a connection between articles and Webflow items. Updates will overwrite the existing Webflow item.
</Tip>

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Authorization Failed

**Problem**: The Webflow OAuth window closes with an error or never returns to Genseo.

**Solution**:

- Make sure you selected at least one site in the OAuth dialog
- Confirm that your Webflow user has access to the project you tried to connect
- Retry the connection and keep the OAuth pop-up open until it redirects back to Genseo

### "Site Not Found" Error

**Problem**: Genseo can't find your Webflow site.

**Solution**:

- Verify you have access to the site in your Webflow account
- Check that the API token has the correct permissions
- Try disconnecting and reconnecting the integration

### "CMS Field Mapping Failed" Error

**Problem**: Genseo can't map fields to your CMS collection.

**Solution**:

- Ensure all required fields exist in your CMS collection
- Check that field types match (e.g., Rich Text for content)
- Verify field names are spelled correctly

### Articles Published But Not Visible

**Problem**: Articles are in Webflow but not showing on your site.

**Solution**:

- Check that your CMS collection is connected to a Collection Page
- Verify the article is set to "Published" in Webflow
- Ensure your Collection Page template is configured correctly

### Slug Conflicts

**Problem**: Multiple articles try to use the same URL slug.

**Solution**:

- Genseo automatically handles slug conflicts by adding numbers
- Manually edit slugs in Webflow if needed
- Consider using unique identifiers in your slug pattern

## Best Practices

- **Test first**: Publish a test article before scheduling multiple articles
- **Backup content**: Keep copies of important articles outside Webflow
- **Monitor publishing**: Check your Webflow CMS after publishing to ensure articles appear correctly
- **Update mappings**: If you change your CMS structure, update field mappings in Genseo
