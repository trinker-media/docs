## Overview

The Webflow integration allows you to publish articles directly to your Webflow CMS collection without manual copy-paste. This guide covers setup, publishing workflows, and troubleshooting.

## Creating a Webflow API Token

Before connecting Genseo to Webflow, you need to create an API token.

### Step 1: Access Webflow Account Settings

1. Log in to your Webflow account
2. Click your profile icon in the top right
3. Select **Account Settings**
4. Navigate to the **Applications** tab

### Step 2: Generate API Token

1. Scroll to the **API Access** section
2. Click **Create New Token**
3. Give your token a name (e.g., "Genseo Integration")
4. Copy the token immediately—you won't be able to see it again

<Warning>
Keep your API token secure. Never share it publicly or commit it to version control.
</Warning>

## Connecting Webflow in Genseo

### Step 1: Add Integration

1. In Genseo, go to **Settings** → **Integrations**
2. Click **Connect Webflow**
3. Paste your API token
4. Click **Connect**

### Step 2: Select Your Site

1. Choose your Webflow site from the dropdown
2. Click **Next**

### Step 3: Map CMS Fields

Genseo needs to know which CMS fields to populate. Map the following:

- **Title field**: Where the article title goes
- **Content field**: Where the article body/content goes
- **Slug field**: The URL slug (optional)
- **Publish date field**: When the article was published (optional)
- **Featured image field**: Article featured image (optional)
- **Author field**: Article author (optional)

<Tip>
If you don't have all these fields, create them in your Webflow CMS collection first. Only the title and content fields are required.
</Tip>

## Publishing Articles to Webflow

### Immediate Publishing

1. Generate or open an article in Genseo
2. Click **Publish**
3. Select **Webflow** as the destination
4. Review the preview
5. Click **Confirm**

The article will be published to your Webflow CMS immediately.

### Scheduled Publishing

1. Generate or open an article
2. Click **Schedule**
3. Select your publish date and time
4. Choose **Webflow** as the destination
5. Click **Schedule**

The article will be published automatically at the scheduled time.

## Updating Articles

When you update an article in Genseo:

1. Make your edits in the Genseo editor
2. Click **Update**
3. Select **Update in Webflow**
4. Confirm the update

<Tip>
Genseo maintains a connection between articles and Webflow items. Updates will overwrite the existing Webflow item.
</Tip>

## Common Issues and Solutions

### "Invalid API Token" Error

**Problem**: Genseo can't authenticate with Webflow.

**Solution**:
- Verify your API token is correct
- Generate a new token in Webflow if needed
- Ensure you copied the entire token (no extra spaces)

### "Site Not Found" Error

**Problem**: Genseo can't find your Webflow site.

**Solution**:
- Verify you have access to the site in your Webflow account
- Check that the API token has the correct permissions
- Try disconnecting and reconnecting the integration

### "CMS Field Mapping Failed" Error

**Problem**: Genseo can't map fields to your CMS collection.

**Solution**:
- Ensure all required fields exist in your CMS collection
- Check that field types match (e.g., Rich Text for content)
- Verify field names are spelled correctly

### Articles Published But Not Visible

**Problem**: Articles are in Webflow but not showing on your site.

**Solution**:
- Check that your CMS collection is connected to a Collection Page
- Verify the article is set to "Published" in Webflow
- Ensure your Collection Page template is configured correctly

### Slug Conflicts

**Problem**: Multiple articles try to use the same URL slug.

**Solution**:
- Genseo automatically handles slug conflicts by adding numbers
- Manually edit slugs in Webflow if needed
- Consider using unique identifiers in your slug pattern

## Best Practices

- **Test first**: Publish a test article before scheduling multiple articles
- **Backup content**: Keep copies of important articles outside Webflow
- **Monitor publishing**: Check your Webflow CMS after publishing to ensure articles appear correctly
- **Update mappings**: If you change your CMS structure, update field mappings in Genseo
