## Overview

Editing is a crucial step in the content creation process. This guide covers how to edit articles in Genseo for clarity, structure, flow, SEO alignment, and formatting best practices.

## The Editing Process

### Why Edit Generated Content?

Even AI-generated content benefits from human editing to:

- **Ensure accuracy**: Verify facts and information
- **Match brand voice**: Align content with your brand
- **Improve clarity**: Make content more readable and understandable
- **Optimize SEO**: Fine-tune SEO elements
- **Add expertise**: Include your unique insights and perspective

## Editing for Clarity

Clear content is easier to read and understand, which improves user experience and SEO.

### Simplify Language

- **Use simple words**: Replace complex words with simpler alternatives when possible
- **Shorten sentences**: Break long sentences into shorter, clearer ones
- **Remove jargon**: Explain technical terms or replace them with accessible language
- **Be direct**: Get to the point without unnecessary fluff

### Improve Readability

- **Use active voice**: Prefer active voice over passive voice
- **Vary sentence length**: Mix short and long sentences for rhythm
- **Use transitions**: Connect ideas with transition words and phrases
- **Break up text**: Use paragraphs, headings, and lists to break up dense text

### Check for Clarity

Ask yourself:
- Is this sentence clear and understandable?
- Does this paragraph have a clear point?
- Will readers understand this without prior knowledge?
- Is the flow logical and easy to follow?

## Editing for Structure

Well-structured content is easier to read and better for SEO.

### Heading Structure

Ensure proper heading hierarchy:

- **H1**: Main title (one per article)
- **H2**: Major sections
- **H3**: Subsections within H2 sections
- **H4+**: Further subdivisions as needed

<Tip>
Maintain a logical heading hierarchy. Don't skip from H2 to H4—use H3 in between.
</Tip>

### Section Organization

Organize content logically:

1. **Introduction**: Hook readers and introduce the topic
2. **Main content**: Develop the topic in clear sections
3. **Conclusion**: Summarize key points and provide next steps

### Use Lists and Formatting

Break up text with:

- **Bullet points**: For lists of items or features
- **Numbered lists**: For step-by-step instructions
- **Bold text**: For emphasis on key points
- **Italic text**: For emphasis or foreign terms
- **Code blocks**: For code examples or technical terms

## Editing for Flow

Smooth flow keeps readers engaged and makes content easier to follow.

### Logical Progression

Ensure content flows logically:

- **Start broad, get specific**: Begin with general concepts, then dive into details
- **Build on previous points**: Each section should build on the previous one
- **Use transitions**: Connect ideas with transition words and phrases
- **Maintain focus**: Stay on topic and avoid tangents

### Paragraph Structure

Structure paragraphs effectively:

- **One idea per paragraph**: Each paragraph should focus on one main idea
- **Topic sentences**: Start paragraphs with clear topic sentences
- **Supporting details**: Follow topic sentences with supporting details
- **Concluding thoughts**: End paragraphs with a conclusion or transition

### Connection Between Sections

Connect sections smoothly:

- **Use transition sentences**: Bridge gaps between sections
- **Reference previous sections**: Refer back to earlier points when relevant
- **Preview coming sections**: Hint at what's coming next when helpful

## Editing for SEO Alignment

SEO alignment ensures your content ranks well in search results.

### Keyword Placement

Place keywords strategically:

- **Title**: Include the primary keyword in the title
- **H1**: Use the keyword in the H1 heading
- **First paragraph**: Include the keyword early in the introduction
- **Headings**: Use variations of the keyword in H2 and H3 headings
- **Body**: Use the keyword naturally throughout the content
- **Meta description**: Include the keyword in the meta description

<Tip>
Don't overuse keywords. Focus on natural, readable content first, then optimize for SEO.
</Tip>

### Internal Linking

Add internal links strategically:

- **Link to related content**: Link to other articles on your site
- **Use descriptive anchor text**: Make anchor text descriptive and relevant
- **Link naturally**: Place links where they make sense contextually
- **Don't over-link**: Too many links can hurt readability and SEO

### Meta Elements

Optimize meta elements:

- **Title tag**: Keep under 60 characters, include primary keyword
- **Meta description**: Keep under 160 characters, include keyword and call-to-action
- **Alt text**: Add descriptive alt text to images
- **URL slug**: Use a clean, keyword-rich URL slug

## Formatting Best Practices

Good formatting improves readability and user experience.

### Use Headings Effectively

- **Clear, descriptive headings**: Make headings descriptive and informative
- **Consistent style**: Use consistent heading styles throughout
- **Proper hierarchy**: Maintain proper heading hierarchy (H1 → H2 → H3)

### Format Text

- **Bold for emphasis**: Use bold to emphasize key points
- **Italic for emphasis**: Use italic for subtle emphasis or foreign terms
- **Code formatting**: Use code formatting for technical terms, code, or file names
- **Avoid over-formatting**: Don't overuse formatting—it can be distracting

### Use Lists

- **Bullet points**: For unordered lists (features, benefits, items)
- **Numbered lists**: For ordered lists (steps, instructions, sequences)
- **Parallel structure**: Keep list items parallel in structure and style
- **Consistent formatting**: Use consistent formatting for all list items

### Add Images

- **Relevant images**: Include images that support the content
- **Descriptive alt text**: Add alt text to all images for accessibility and SEO
- **Proper sizing**: Ensure images are properly sized and optimized
- **Captions**: Add captions when helpful for context

## Common Editing Issues

### Content Is Too Generic

**Solution**:

- Add data and statistics when relevant

### SEO Over-Optimization

**Problem**: Content is over-optimized for SEO, hurting readability.

**Solution**:
- Remove excessive keyword usage

- Prioritize user experience over SEO optimization

### Poor Structure

**Problem**: Content lacks clear structure or organization.

**Solution**:
