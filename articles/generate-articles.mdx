## Overview

Genseo uses AI to generate complete, SEO-optimized articles based on your keywords. This guide explains how article generation works, how to adjust settings before generating, and how prompts and briefs influence the output.

## How Article Generation Works

### The Generation Process

1. **Keyword analysis**: Genseo analyzes your keyword to understand search intent and topic
2. **Content research**: The system researches the topic to gather relevant information
3. **Article structure**: Genseo creates an SEO-optimized structure with headings and sections
4. **Content generation**: The AI writes the article content based on your settings
5. **SEO optimization**: The article is optimized for search engines with proper keyword placement

### What Gets Generated

Each generated article includes:

- **Title**: SEO-optimized title with your target keyword
- **Introduction**: Engaging introduction that hooks readers
- **Headings**: Proper H1, H2, H3 structure for SEO
- **Content**: Comprehensive, well-structured content
- **Conclusion**: Summary and call-to-action
- **Meta description**: SEO meta description (if configured)

## Article Briefs and Settings

Before generating an article, you can adjust settings that influence the output.

### Tone of Voice

Choose how the article should sound:

- **Professional**: Formal, authoritative tone
- **Friendly**: Conversational, approachable tone
- **Technical**: Detailed, technical language
- **Casual**: Relaxed, informal tone

<Tip>
Match your tone to your brand voice and target audience. For B2B audiences, professional or technical tones often work well. For B2C, friendly or casual tones may be more appropriate.
</Tip>

### Article Length

Control how long the article should be:

- **Short**: 500-800 words (quick reads, simple topics)
- **Medium**: 800-1,500 words (standard blog posts)
- **Long**: 1,500-2,500 words (comprehensive guides)
- **Very long**: 2,500+ words (in-depth resources)

<Tip>
Longer articles often perform better for SEO, but ensure the length matches the topic. Simple topics don't need 2,500 words, while complex topics benefit from comprehensive coverage.
</Tip>

### Target Audience

Define who the article is for:

- **General audience**: Broad, accessible language
- **Beginners**: Simple explanations, no jargon
- **Intermediate**: Assumes some knowledge
- **Experts**: Advanced, technical content

### Content Focus

Specify what the article should emphasize:

- **Educational**: Focus on teaching and explaining
- **How-to**: Step-by-step instructions
- **Comparison**: Compare options or approaches
- **Analysis**: Deep dive into a topic

## Custom Prompts

For advanced control, you can provide custom prompts that guide the generation process.

### What Are Prompts?

Prompts are instructions that tell Genseo exactly what you want in the article. They can include:

- Specific points to cover
- Structure requirements
- Style guidelines
- Examples to reference

### Example Prompts

**Basic prompt**:
```
Write a comprehensive guide to SEO optimization. Include sections on keyword research, on-page SEO, and technical SEO. Use a professional tone and include practical examples.
```

**Detailed prompt**:
```
Create an article about content marketing for SaaS companies. Structure it as follows:
1. Introduction to content marketing
2. Why content marketing matters for SaaS
3. Content marketing strategies
4. Measuring success
5. Best practices
Use a friendly, conversational tone and include real-world examples from successful SaaS companies.
```

### Best Practices for Prompts

- **Be specific**: Clear, specific instructions produce better results
- **Define structure**: Outline the structure you want
- **Specify tone**: Include tone and style preferences
- **Provide examples**: Reference examples when helpful
- **Set expectations**: Clarify what the article should achieve

## Adjusting Before Confirming

Before confirming article generation, you can:

### Review the Brief

Check that your settings are correct:

1. Verify the keyword is correct
2. Review tone, length, and audience settings
3. Check custom prompts if provided
4. Ensure settings match your content strategy

### Make Adjustments

If something needs to change:

1. Adjust tone, length, or audience settings
2. Modify custom prompts
3. Change the target keyword if needed
4. Update content focus

### Preview Structure

Some plans allow you to preview the article structure before generation:

1. Review the proposed structure
2. Adjust sections if needed
3. Add or remove sections
4. Confirm when satisfied

## After Generation

Once the article is generated:

### Review the Content

1. **Read through**: Check the article for accuracy and quality
2. **Verify SEO**: Ensure proper keyword placement and structure
3. **Check tone**: Confirm the tone matches your brand
4. **Assess completeness**: Ensure all important points are covered

### Make Edits

Use the Genseo editor to:

### Regenerate if Needed

If the article doesn't meet your needs:

1. Click **Regenerate**
2. Adjust settings or prompts
3. Generate a new version
4. Compare with the previous version

## Best Practices

### Before Generation

- **Choose the right keyword**: Ensure your keyword is specific and relevant
- **Set appropriate length**: Match length to the topic complexity
- **Match tone to audience**: Use a tone that resonates with your target audience
- **Provide clear prompts**: Give specific instructions for better results

### During Generation
