## Republishing Updates

When you update an article in Genseo, you need to republish it to update the live version.

### Updating Published Articles

1. Make your edits in the Genseo editor
2. Click **Update**
3. Select **Update in [Integration]** (Webflow or Shopify)
4. Review the changes
5. Click **Confirm**

The article will be updated in your integration, overwriting the previous version.

<Tip>
Genseo maintains a connection between articles and published content. Updates will automatically update the correct item in your integration.
</Tip>

### Handling Major Updates

For major updates that change the article significantly:

1. **Review impact**: Consider if the update changes the article's core message
2. **Check SEO**: Ensure SEO elements (title, slug, keywords) are still appropriate
3. **Update metadata**: Update meta descriptions and other metadata if needed
4. **Test links**: Verify internal and external links still work
5. **Republish**: Republish the updated article

## Checking Live Previews

Before publishing, review how your article will appear on your site.

### Preview in Genseo

Genseo provides a preview of how your article will look:

1. Click **Preview** before publishing
2. Review the article structure and formatting
3. Check that images and links display correctly
4. Verify SEO elements are properly formatted

### Preview in Integration

After publishing, check the live version:

#### For Webflow

1. Go to your Webflow CMS
2. Find the published article
3. Click **Preview** to see how it appears on your site
4. Check the live URL to see the public version

#### For Shopify

1. Go to your Shopify admin
2. Navigate to **Online Store** → **Blog posts**
3. Find the published article
4. Click **View** to see how it appears on your storefront

### Common Preview Issues

**Images not displaying**:
- Check that image URLs are correct
- Verify images are accessible
- Ensure images meet integration requirements

**Formatting issues**:
- Review HTML formatting in the integration
- Check that your theme supports the formatting
- Adjust formatting in the integration if needed

**Links not working**:
- Verify link URLs are correct
- Check that links use proper protocols (http:// or https://)
- Test links in the live version

## Avoiding Slug Conflicts

URL slugs must be unique. Conflicts occur when multiple articles try to use the same slug.

### How Genseo Handles Slugs

Genseo automatically generates slugs from article titles:

1. **Convert to lowercase**: Title is converted to lowercase
2. **Replace spaces**: Spaces are replaced with hyphens
3. **Remove special characters**: Special characters are removed or converted
4. **Handle conflicts**: If a slug exists, Genseo adds a number (e.g., `article-2`)

### Preventing Slug Conflicts

- **Use unique titles**: Ensure article titles are unique
- **Check existing slugs**: Review existing articles before creating new ones
- **Customize slugs**: Manually set slugs when needed to avoid conflicts
- **Use descriptive slugs**: Make slugs descriptive and keyword-rich

### Resolving Slug Conflicts

If you encounter a slug conflict:

1. **Edit the slug**: Manually edit the slug in Genseo before publishing
2. **Update in integration**: If already published, update the slug in your integration
3. **Use redirects**: Set up redirects if you change a published article's slug

## Common Publishing Issues

### Publishing Fails

**Problem**: Article fails to publish to your integration.

**Solution**:
- Verify your integration is properly connected
- Check that you have publish permissions in your integration
- Ensure required fields are mapped correctly
- Try publishing again after a few minutes

### Article Not Visible

**Problem**: Article is published but not visible on your site.

**Solution**:
- Check that the article is set to "Published" in your integration
- Verify your integration's publishing settings
- Ensure your site theme is configured to display the content
- Check for any caching issues

### Formatting Lost

**Problem**: Article formatting is lost when published.

**Solution**:
- Review HTML formatting in your integration
- Check that your theme supports the formatting used
- Adjust formatting in your integration's editor if needed
- Verify that Genseo is sending properly formatted HTML

### Images Not Uploading

**Problem**: Images aren't uploading to your integration.

**Solution**:
- Check that images meet file size and format requirements
- Verify image URLs are accessible
- Ensure you have sufficient storage in your integration
- Try uploading images manually if needed
